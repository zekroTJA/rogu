# rogu

ログ (*rogu*, jap. *log*) is *yet another* taggable, human readable, colorful, structured logging package with a builder-like API. This package is mainly created to be used within [shinpuru](https://github.com/zekrotja/shinpuru) and other projects of mine. Feel free to use it too, but beware that this package is not optimized for performance.

This package is very much inspired by the colored output style of [charmbracelet/log](https://github.com/charmbracelet/log) and the builder API style of [rs/zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog).
